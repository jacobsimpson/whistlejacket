            Whistle Jacket Training offers only the best in training and
            instruction for all horses and all riders. With over 20 years
            experience our goal is to provide each individual with a customized
            program to fit their needs.

          <div class="col-12 text-center" data-aos="fade">
            <p>
            Our program is about learning to listen, learning to be softer,
            learning to be mindful and thoughtful. This means taking things
            slowly and trying to understand things more from the horse’s
            perspective. Whether we’re doing ground work, riding, or training
            the goal is careful and methodical work where we strive to
            understand our horses and do our best for them.
            </p>

            The experience of horses is unlike any other in life as they offer
            us relationship, softness, beauty, simplicity, wrapped up in
            mystery and wildness and strength that touches something deep in
            the soul. And the amazing part is that horses are so desperate to
            communicate with us, but we have to be willing to listen and to
            take the time to let them teach us.

            Full care $800 per month.  Horses live in loafing sheds with
            attached gravel paddocks year round, and access to a track system
            or grass pastures to suit their needs. We use slow feeder systems
            and turnout space to provide food access 24/7, which takes away the
            stress at feeding time and encourages movement. Horses can share
            spaces, or live as individuals.  Paddocks and turnout areas are
            cleaned daily and kept mud free through careful management.
            Property features a covered arena, covered round pen and trails on
            the 60 acre property for enjoyment year round.

                <h3>Groundwork Lessons</h3>
                <p>
                The relationship with our horses is first established from the
                ground, where we have a profound impact. Spending time doing
                intentional exercises from the ground gives riders a chance to
                observe how their horse thinks and moves. For the horse these
                exercises engage the thinking side of their brain, rather than
                the reactive side, which helps them be more confident and
                relaxed which is a much better starting place for any riding.
                </p>
                <p>
                Groundwork includes basic leading exercises, maneuverability
                exercises to move forehand and hindquarters, lateral work for
                suppling using leg-yield and shoulder-in, thoughtful exercises
                with obstacles like poles, barrels and cones, also lunging, and
                liberty work in the round pen.

                <h3>Riding Instruction</h3>
                <p>
                  Riding lessons are about equipping the rider’s mind and body
                  to be able to better communicate and adapt with their horse
                  as they forge a riding relationship together. First this is
                  about understanding how the rider’s body affects the horse.
                  This approach is focused primarily on the seat and taking the
                  time needed to build a strong foundation- sometimes this
                  means working on the lunge line, even without stirrups and
                  reins. Second it is about body control through balance,
                  movement and softness to communicate with their horse in a
                  way that helps the horse understand. Horses always want us to
                  be softer and quieter, more like a physical therapist than a
                  boot camp sergeant!
                </p>

                <h3>Thoughtful Dressage Training</h3>
                <p>
                  A training approach based in Classical dressage with a focus
                  on helping horses be comfortable and thoughtful about their
                  bodies and the work being asked of them. This means careful
                  and methodical training that develops both mental willingness
                  and physical balance and softness. Time and care is taken for
                  each horse to meet their individual needs with no rushing; a
                  well trained horse is a pleasure to ride for a lifetime, not
                  just a few prime years. Training combines groundwork, lunging
                  and riding sessions as appropriate for each horse and owner
                  combination.

                Whistle Jacket Training was founded in 2006 by Kim Holley
                although Kim’s passion or horses started long before that.
                Having started riding when she was 12, she gained much of her
                Classical dressage foundation from a long apprenticeship with
                an Arabian breeder who trained in the Classical style. Her
                experience with Arabians was wide and varied from breeding to
                starting young horses to preparing horses for the show ring and
                competing, but most of all she learned lightness from the
                highly sensitive and intelligent breed. Kim graduated in 2004
                from Rocky Mt College in Billings, MT with a BS in Equestrian
                Business, and soon started her training business. Since then
                she has had opportunity to work with many horses and riders, do
                some competing, attend clinics and refine her skills and
                philosophy as a horse trainer. Kim enjoys pulling from a wide
                range of trainers including Classical Dressage masters like
                Podhajsky, Steinbrecht and DeKunffy, as well as Horsemanship
                trainers like Mark Rashid and Buck Brannaman, and has been
                greatly influenced by biomechanics specialists like Sally
                Swift, Mary Wanless and Gerd Heuschmann. Kim finds delight in
                the journey and the promise of growth in her students and
                horses, and enjoys being a part of their learning and progress.

                Kim’s Philosophy
              </p>
              <p>
                The most valuable tool we have with our horses is a
                relationship of trust and understanding. Horse have such deep
                souls and have so much to give, the journey is about diving
                into those depths and discovering what they have to teach us.
                Each horse and human relationship is unique so the aim is to
                explore what works for each individual.
              </p>
              <p>
                We tend to ask so much of our horses expecting them to
                acclimate and engage in our human world in the ways we choose,
                but what if we approached each encounter with less of an agenda
                and more of a conversation- both talking and listening? Given
                time and opportunity I think we might find that our horses have
                so much to tell us, and are very interested in communicating!
              </p>
              <p>
                A horse’s world is simple in many ways: they desire food and
                safety and comfort, and in each of these they thrive on
                consistency. This builds trust and through trust comes greater
                softness, willingness and even interest in the things we ask
                them to do. What seems to be the hardest part for us to
                understand though, is that this takes time. We often are in a
                hurry to get somewhere, or we’re task driven so we want to
                practice a skill again and again until we get it right. The
                challenge is that horses don’t see the world this way, and
                usually the more we try the worse things get. We have to be
                willing to slow down and let go of our timelines and agendas
                and be willing to work with the horse at their pace.
              </p>
              <p>
                The more I work with horses the more I realize my own
                shortcomings but from that I gain a greater appreciation for
                what horses offer, despite my mistakes. And I strive to listen
                better, and to wait longer, and to adapt to what the horse
                needs as I ask them to adapt to what I desire, a partnership.
                The same is true of my approach to teaching people to ride or
                work with horses. Each individual brings their unique desires
                and needs to the experience and we journey together, listening
                and talking, working and resting, thinking and doing, however
                long it takes, doing our utmost to enjoy the time together
                along the way.
